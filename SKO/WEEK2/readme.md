To commence our second week we started by learning about and researching modular typography. One example that I found was by [Kelvin Ha](https://kelvinha.com/Modular-Type). He describes this ‘modular type project’ as a concept ‘based on illusion and negative space’ inspired by ‘the theory and practice of Japanese sculptor, medallist, graphic artist and poster designer, Shigeo Fukuda’. Fukuda’s influence is evident in Ha’s manipulation of form and colour to distort perspective as ‘the alphabet can be 2D or 3D depending on the viewer’s’ optical emphasis.


## + starting assignment 2

We also started to look at assignment 2 this week, our House of Leaves virtual rereading. My group, Ruby, Hamish, Fergus, and I, decided to select the virtual world of Club Penguin. It will be interesting to see how we are about to link the slightly erratic narrative and disorienting structure of House of Leaves with a game as innocent as Club Penguin.
