We started our first class in the world of Minecraft. This was a great, fun activity to allow every student to virtually interact in an engaging way beyond the regular online learning experience.

Our first introduction to coding involved becoming acquainted with Processing and p5.js. As someone who had no previous coding experience, I found this tutorial easy to follow and replicate myself, which definitely helped to ease some of the apprehension I felt going into the course. We were asked to attempt the software ourselves and recreate our own initials. I really enjoyed the challenges of this task and the immense satisfaction I felt when I finally succeeded. For my [C](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK1/letter_C) and [M](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK1/letter_M), I really enjoyed using the mouseY and mouseX functions to make the fill change fluidly as you moved your mouse. If I were to do this task again, I might try playing with more abstract letterforms or more functions including the mouseY and mouseX commands to change the size or shape the letter.
