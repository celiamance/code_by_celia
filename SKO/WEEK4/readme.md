To begin our fourth week of class we started with another power hour of code with Karen. We learnt how to upload fonts onto Processing using the preload() function and how to code text to change the size, position and to animate it. Our [second type test](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK4/type_test2) involved using mouseX and mouseY functions again, making it a engaging, interactive outcome.


## + assignment 2 continued

Out group also met up via FaceTime quite a few times throughout the past few weeks to organise and record our Club Penguin rereading. We also worked on editing our allocated sections of the video.

## + sketch of the week

To practice uploading and using a font in Processing, I made a variation of an early sketch, rainbow circles. [This version](https://celiamance.github.io/codewords/SKO/WEEK4/shadow) has the word 'shadow' using the Glyph World typeface - Desert, following your mouse. I used a slightly transparent background so the words slowly fade and also added in a clear command under a key pressed function.
